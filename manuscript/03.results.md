### Figure 2

![**Figure 2: Protein factors reveal significant treatment-time dependent relationships.** (A) Heatmap of protein factors. Pink color indicates a negative correlation along a component, while green indicates a positive correlation. Measurements were non-normalized and proteins with a value greater or less than 0.2 were plotted to eliminate insignificant values. (B) Numerical protein relationships along all components, centered around zero. Behavior of treatments on proteins over time in components 4 (C), 5 (D), and 1 (E).](./figure2.svg){#fig:fig2}

### Figure 3

![**Figure 3: Reverse projection of treatment-time to gene expression connects downstream protein production to treatment-induced genetic alteration.** (A) Cartoon of reverse projection process. (B) Gene expression data behavior in component 4 and 5. Outlier genes are labeled. (C) OSM fold change vs IFN fold change for components 4 and 5. (D) False discovery rate (FDR) across enriched gene sets. Colors represent different components.](./figure3.svg){#fig:fig3}

    Parameters:

            Data tensor with which to perform factorization
        rank: int
            Number of component vectors desired along each axis during factorization

    Returns:
        factors: list of numpy arrays (length: dimensionality of the tensor)
            List of arrays containing the components for each axis (i.e. Factors[0] is the array containing the components for the first axis)
